# Data Protection Compliance Report

## Executive Summary
This report assesses compliance posture for data protection controls associated with repository operations and supporting systems.

## Scope
* Data classification and handling guidance.
* Retention and secure disposal controls.
* Encryption and key management practices.
* Access control for sensitive data artifacts.

## Assessment Results
Domain | Compliance Status | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Data classification | Medium-High | Framework exists, adoption uneven
Retention/disposal | Medium | Disposal evidence needs consistency
Encryption controls | High | Strong baseline, minor operational gaps
Access restrictions | Medium-High | Mostly aligned with policy

## Key Gaps
* Incomplete retention execution logs for some datasets.
* Inconsistent data labeling in older artifacts.
* Limited periodic attestation from data owners.

## Corrective Action Plan
Gap | Action | Target
--- | --- | ---
Retention evidence gaps | Implement disposal audit log template | 30 days
Labeling inconsistencies | Backfill classification tags on legacy assets | 45 days
Owner attestation drift | Introduce quarterly data-owner confirmation workflow | 60 days

## Recommended Compliance Metrics
* Percentage of assets with classification labels.
* Percentage of disposal jobs with verifiable evidence.
* Number of open high-risk data-protection exceptions.

## Conclusion
Control framework is strong, but evidence maturity and consistent execution must improve to sustain audit readiness.
