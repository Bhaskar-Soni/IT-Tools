# Incident Response Exercise Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents outcomes from an incident response exercise and identifies capability improvements for readiness.

## Exercise Scenario
Simulated event: credential compromise affecting repository automation and high-privilege workflow operations.

## Objectives
* Validate detection and escalation timeline.
* Test containment and credential rotation process.
* Evaluate communication and decision logging quality.
* Assess post-incident remediation planning.

## Performance Results
Area | Observation | Maturity
--- | --- | ---
Detection and triage | Initial triage timely | Medium-High
Containment workflow | Effective but documentation uneven | Medium
Communication cadence | Clear for core team | Medium
Post-incident task closure | Action tracking started, needs stricter follow-up | Medium-Low

## Improvement Actions
1. Add standardized incident timeline template.
2. Define mandatory communication intervals by severity.
3. Improve automation for token revocation and verification.
4. Enforce closure deadlines for corrective actions.

## Recommended Next Exercise
Run a scenario focusing on dependency supply-chain compromise with cross-team coordination and rollback validation.

## Conclusion
Response fundamentals are present, but evidence rigor and post-incident closure discipline need measurable improvement.
