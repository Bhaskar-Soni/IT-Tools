# Vendor Assurance Review Report

## Executive Summary
This report reviews assurance posture of third-party services and integrations used by repository operations.

## Review Scope
* Security controls and assurance artifacts.
* Access scope and credential lifecycle.
* Availability and incident communication commitments.
* Data handling and retention transparency.

## Assurance Snapshot
Area | Maturity | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Security attestation availability | Medium | Present for some vendors
Access scope minimization | Medium | Needs periodic re-validation
Offboarding controls | Medium-Low | Evidence collection inconsistent
Incident notification commitments | Medium | Contract terms vary by vendor

## Findings
* Vendor risk tiering exists but reassessment cadence needs stronger enforcement.
* Integration token permissions are not consistently reviewed.
* Offboarding evidence should be standardized and centrally tracked.

## Action Plan
1. Build annual reassessment calendar by vendor tier.
2. Require scope/permission review for every active integration.
3. Define mandatory offboarding checklist with evidence artifacts.
4. Track incident notification SLA compliance where contractual.

## Conclusion
Assurance posture is improving, but lifecycle governance (reassessment and offboarding proof) remains the primary risk area.
