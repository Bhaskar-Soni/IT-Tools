# Compliance Gap Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report identifies gaps between expected control requirements and currently implemented repository governance/security practices.

## Reference Baseline
* Internal policy framework.
* Common control domains aligned to security governance standards.
* Operational evidence expectations for audit readiness.

## Control Coverage Snapshot
Domain | Status | Gap Level
--- | --- | ---
Access control governance | Implemented with partial evidence | Medium
Vulnerability management | Implemented | Low
Incident response process | Implemented with exercise gaps | Medium
Data retention and disposal | Implemented | Low
Vendor risk governance | Newly defined | Medium
Privacy governance | Defined, needs operational evidence | Medium

## Top Gaps
1. Evidence maturity:
   * Control evidence is not consistently packaged for audit.
2. Operational cadence:
   * Some review cycles are documented but not yet institutionalized.
3. Exception lifecycle:
   * Exception expiry and re-approval checks need automation.

## Remediation Plan
Gap | Recommended Action | Target Date
--- | --- | ---
Audit evidence inconsistency | Create unified evidence collection standard | 30 days
Review cadence drift | Implement quarterly compliance calendar | 30 days
Exception governance | Introduce tracked exception register with expiry alerts | 45 days

## Residual Risk
Current residual risk: `Moderate`  
Expected residual risk after remediation: `Low to Moderate`

## Next Assessment
Run follow-up compliance gap analysis after remediation cycle completion (within 90 days).
