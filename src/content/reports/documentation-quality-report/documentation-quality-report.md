## Executive Summary
This report evaluates documentation quality across guides, notes, lists, policies, and reports with emphasis on consistency, clarity, and operational usefulness.

## Scope
* Structural consistency and formatting.
* Content completeness and practical relevance.
* Category mapping quality.
* Placeholder/stale content detection.

## Quality Dimensions
Dimension | Assessment Focus
--- | ---
Clarity | Is intent understandable quickly?
Completeness | Are required sections and details present?
Accuracy | Are commands/processes still valid?
Consistency | Is style and structure aligned?
Maintainability | Is ownership and update cadence clear?

## Findings
* Significant improvement from replacing placeholder content.
* Category structure now richer and more navigable.
* Remaining opportunity: standardize metadata quality in all index files.
* Remaining opportunity: define documentation review cadence per content type.

## Recommendations
1. Adopt per-content-type quality checklist.
2. Enforce periodic stale-content scans.
3. Require "last reviewed" metadata for high-impact documents.
4. Introduce lightweight editorial review for major additions.

## Proposed Documentation KPIs
* Percentage of documents with no placeholders.
* Percentage of documents reviewed in last 6 months.
* Broken/outdated reference rate.
* Category coverage completeness per content type.

## Conclusion
Documentation quality is trending strongly positive; formal review cadence and metadata standardization are the next maturity step.
