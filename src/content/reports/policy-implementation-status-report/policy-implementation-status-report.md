# Policy Implementation Status Report

## Executive Summary
This report tracks implementation maturity of repository policy documents and associated operating controls.

## Status Matrix
Policy Domain | Policy Defined | Operationalized | Evidence Ready
--- | --- | --- | ---
Security | Yes | Partial to high | Partial
Data Protection | Yes | High | Partial to high
Usage/Process | Yes | High | Partial
Governance/Compliance | Yes | Medium | Partial
Risk/Vendor/Privacy | Yes | Medium | Low to medium

## Maturity Scale
Level | Meaning
--- | ---
1 | Draft only
2 | Approved policy, limited execution
3 | Executed process, inconsistent evidence
4 | Executed process with consistent evidence
5 | Continuous improvement with metrics

## Current Maturity Estimate
Domain | Maturity
--- | ---
Security | 3.5
Data Protection | 3.8
Usage | 4.0
Compliance/Governance | 3.0
Privacy and Vendor Risk | 2.8

## Key Blockers
* Evidence automation not fully standardized.
* Inconsistent ownership updates for some newer domains.
* Metrics pipeline not centralized.

## Recommended Actions
1. Assign explicit policy owners and deputies for every domain.
2. Implement monthly evidence collection checkpoints.
3. Create single dashboard for control maturity and overdue actions.

## Target State (Next 2 Quarters)
* Achieve minimum maturity `4` for all critical security and data protection domains.
* Reduce evidence gaps to less than 10% of required controls.
