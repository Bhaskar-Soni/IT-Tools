# Vulnerability Management Policy

## 1. Purpose
Define how vulnerabilities are identified, triaged, remediated, and validated across this repository and related systems.

## 2. Scope
Includes source code, dependencies, CI/CD workflows, infrastructure-as-code, container images, and deployment artifacts.

## 3. Discovery Methods
* Dependency scanning on every merge and scheduled scans.
* Static analysis for source code security issues.
* Container and image scanning before release.
* Manual security testing for high-risk features.

## 4. Severity and Remediation SLAs
Severity | Target Fix Time
--- | ---
Critical | 48 hours
High | 7 calendar days
Medium | 30 calendar days
Low | 90 calendar days

## 5. Triage Rules
1. Confirm exploitability and affected assets.
2. Validate false positives before closure.
3. Assign an owner and due date.
4. Track all findings in a centralized issue system.

## 6. Remediation Standards
* Use vendor-supported patches and versions.
* Prefer permanent fixes over temporary suppression.
* Document risk acceptance decisions for deferred fixes.
* Re-test after remediation to confirm closure.

## 7. Exception Handling
* Exception requests require: business justification, risk rating, mitigation plan, and expiration date.
* Exceptions older than 90 days require re-approval.

## 8. Reporting
* Weekly security backlog report for open critical/high findings.
* Monthly trend reporting: open vs closed, mean-time-to-remediate.
* Executive escalation for overdue critical findings.

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities
* Security owner: triage standards and reporting.
* Engineering owner: remediation and testing.
* Repository maintainers: ensure blocking gates for severe issues.

## 10. Review Cycle
Review at least annually or after significant security events.

## 11. Governance and Ownership
* Policy owner: Security Lead.
* Finding owners: Engineering maintainers for affected components.
* Escalation owner: Repository governance team.

## 12. Risk Acceptance Requirements
Risk acceptance is allowed only when:
1. Fix is not currently feasible.
2. Compensating controls are implemented.
3. Business owner signs acceptance with expiry date.
4. Security owner approves and tracks review checkpoints.

## 13. Required Evidence
* Scanner output and triage decision.
* Fix commit/PR reference.
* Validation proof after remediation.
* Exception records with expiration.

## 14. Program Metrics
* Mean time to remediate by severity.
* Open critical/high findings over time.
* Ratio of false positives to confirmed findings.
* Overdue findings by team/component.

## 15. Document Control
